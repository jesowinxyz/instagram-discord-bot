# 📸 Instagram Thumbnail Fetching Guide

## ✨ New Smart Thumbnail System

Your bot now has an **intelligent thumbnail fetching system** that:
- ✅ **Automatically fetches** thumbnails from Instagram (3 different methods)
- ✅ **Detects failures** and prompts you for custom thumbnail
- ✅ **Never posts without a proper thumbnail**
- ✅ **Supports multiple input methods**

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Method 1: Auto-Fetch (Preferred)
When you post an Instagram link, the bot tries **3 different methods** to fetch the thumbnail:

1. **Facebook Graph API** - Most reliable for public posts
2. **Instagram oEmbed API** - Direct from Instagram  
3. **Page Scraping** - Extracts thumbnail from HTML

**If ALL methods fail**, the bot will **stop and ask you** for a custom thumbnail!

### Method 2: Custom Thumbnail (Backup)
If auto-fetch fails, you have several options:

---

## 📥 Ways to Provide Custom Thumbnails

### Option 1: Use the Panel (!panel)
1. Type `!panel` in your control channel
2. Click the button to open the form
3. Paste Instagram URL
4. **If prompted**, click "Add Custom Thumbnail" button
5. Paste your thumbnail URL

### Option 2: Use !reel with Attachment
```
!reel https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123/
```
**Attach an image** to your message before sending!

### Option 3: Use !custompost Command
```
!custompost https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123/ https://i.imgur.com/thumbnail.jpg
```

### Option 4: DM with Attachment

## ⚠️ What Happens on Failure

If the bot **can't fetch a thumbnail automatically**, you'll see:

```
⚠️ Unable to auto-fetch thumbnail!

Please provide a custom thumbnail URL to complete the post.

How to get an image URL:
1️⃣ Upload image to Discord (DM yourself) → Right-click → Copy Link
2️⃣ Use ImgBB.com → Upload → Copy Direct Link
3️⃣ Use PostImages.org → Upload → Copy Direct Link
```

**The post will NOT be published** until you provide a valid thumbnail!

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always try auto-fetch first** - Let the bot try to get the thumbnail
2. **Have a backup ready** - Screenshot the Instagram post as backup
3. **Use Discord CDN** - Most reliable for custom thumbnails
4. **Test the URL** - Make sure the thumbnail URL works before pasting
